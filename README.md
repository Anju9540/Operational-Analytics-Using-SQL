# 📊 **Operational Analytics Using SQL**  

## 📝 **Project Overview**  
Operational Analytics is a crucial process that involves analyzing a company's end-to-end operations. This analysis helps identify areas for improvement within the company. As a **Lead Data Analyst**, you will derive valuable insights from data collected by various departments such as operations, support, and marketing.  

One of the key aspects of Operational Analytics is **investigating metric spikes**, such as sudden changes in key performance indicators (KPIs). In this project, you will use **advanced SQL techniques** to analyze company data, identify trends, and provide data-driven solutions.

## 🏢 **Case Studies in This Project**  

### **📌 Case Study 1: Job Data Analysis**  
In this case study, you will work with **job_data**, a dataset containing job review records. You will analyze various aspects such as:  
- **Jobs Reviewed Over Time** – Tracking jobs reviewed per hour for November 2020.  
- **Throughput Analysis** – Measuring the 7-day rolling average of throughput.  
- **Language Share Analysis** – Calculating the percentage share of each language over the last 30 days.  
- **Duplicate Rows Detection** – Identifying duplicate records in the dataset.  

### **📌 Case Study 2: Investigating Metric Spikes**  
In this case study, you will analyze user engagement trends using three datasets: **users, events, and email_events**. Your tasks include:  
- **Weekly User Engagement** – Measuring user activity trends over time.  
- **User Growth Analysis** – Analyzing how the user base has grown over time.  
- **Weekly Retention Analysis** – Calculating the weekly retention of users after signing up.
